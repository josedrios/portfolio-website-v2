## The Coding Gym

I train in the gym 5 times a week, following the plan I curated to make me look like Serge Nubret. I train hard and recover harder. Yet when it comes to coding, I don't know why but I don't take the same approach. 

### My Code Training Lacks Structure

For coding I learn the basics of a language or framework, once I feel like I am able to go on my own and create something, I do. I go straight into a project and learn the rest of the language that way, through experience and trial and error. What I am starting to realize is that the issue in my learning of programming lies within the lack of structure. 

It starts off organization then ends up with wandering endlessly into various concepts, sometimes leaving those concepts mid way and picking up another. The plus side is that I am simutaneously learning and building but I am starting to believe that one should get the language/framework down to a very solid understanding then go crazy when building. If not, you are going to be constantly gassing and braking. You don't build a house learning about the tools and techniques needed to build one while you are building it (maybe some people do, I don't know that just wouldn't make sense to me).

## My Training Plan

I will be a learning C++ for the next coming weeks. I found a book called *C++ in One Hour a Day* at my local library. I will most likely not stick to just an hour a day because that seems too little. I will just study the concepts in order and move on when I feel I am ready.The book provides 31 sections that each represent a day. Each day contains a new topic on C++. 

My approach is to go in with a fresh mind to absorb everything as it should be, with no previous knowledge messing with my current learning process. I will be taking notes and putting to practice every section I learn and will probably make blog posts about some sections. Will I make a blog about EVERY section? Probably not. I do find that trying to explain what I learnt helps me understand the concepts better because it also exposes what I don't really understand. It makes me go back to study mode and get that patched up. So maybe I will only blog about the bigger more complex topics.

## The Catch

No AI. For the entire process I will not be using the help of AI to learn C++. You can say this is my "challenge run". I will be using all other resources but AI. Stack overflow, simple google searches, Youtube videos, etc. 

The only exception is if I am stuck in a certain part of the learning process for hours, restricting me from learning. Only then I will potentially use the help of AI to get me past that obstacle.

## Why?

It's like using summons in Elden Ring, although there is nothing wrong with it I just feel like its to easy and makes me too accustom to getting what I want, when I want it. I to be in full control of my learning process and not depend on AI to spoon-feed me answers. I want to make the effort of finding what I need. You may be asking "Jose are you actually not going to use AI to help you learn C++?" and with that I would reply with the Walter White meme where he says "You're goddamn right". I refuse.

## Expected Outcome

Become jacked (in C++) like I stated. Jokes aside, the ultimate goal is to become a capable, competent developer. Learning a language like C++, which is so highly documented and with a big community behind it, I feel like it would help me a lot in the process as well. I want to kill the feeling of being foreign to certain programming concepts and give more life to the part of me where I am constantly learning and curious on how to become a developer that gets stuff done. (I really wanted to say the S word there but I want keep the language on here relatively clean)

P.S: I was thinking of getting a grammar checker for my blogs but I refuse. I respect blogs too much to run it pass through some software rather than meticulously checking my own work myself. I will be held accountable for all typos and weird phrases.
