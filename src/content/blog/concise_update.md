## Jinx

I got a job as a coding coach recently which is super fun. I don't really like talking about personal stuff that I am working on or is still developing because I have a strong, unjustified superstition that it will jinx something so I will leave it at that.

## Superman's Weapons

I forgot to blog about two movies I have watched not too long ago. 

Superman was very good. It was nothing groundbreaking. It was your standard classic hero movie. I liked it. The shot where he floats through and above the smoke, and all you can see his silhouette was my favorite part. I watched it on the first day of release, the environment was really cool.

Weapons I liked a lot. Reminded me of how it felt to watch Barbarian. The perfect balance between comedy and suspense. I liked how the story was built by tagging on to different character's perspectives, all tip toeing around the main plot. My favorite part was the ending. Many people didn't like it but I loved it.

## Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater

Quick update. I have been playing the Metal Gear Solid series in order. I have played 1 and 2 and now 3.

One of the greatest games I have ever played in my life. The gameplay and story are one of none. I only say one of the greatest games because my list of top 5-10 games are always rotating due to my inability to give a video (or any piece of media for that matter) a set rating. I would not be suprised if later down the line I actually sat down and deemed it #1 after the game has marinated in my mind.

### Unstable Ranking

I always randomly remember a cutscene, or a boss fight, or a general memory or feeling playing a game and that is enough to shift the rankings. I can confidently say as of right now, writing this blog, that Elden Ring and MGS3 are competing for the unstable #1 spot right now. Maybe an hour from now I'll remember how great Batman Arkham Asylum was or Assassin's Creed 2 and how nostalgic that was for me. Sorry for the tangent.

### Big Boss

**The hype was real**. 

As soon as you see him smoking a cigar on the opening cutscene, I felt his presence in my soul. I'm not trying to over glaze but it's the truth. The dude was a stud. I did see him as less charismatic as Solid Snake but Solid Snake didn't have the troubles this man went through. Solid Snake had it good with the map. 

The goat. My goat. Solid Snake is also my goat but *also* doesn't make sense here because they are so similar. 

### The Boss

What a beautiful woman. With how little her screen time was, the game does an amazing job showing how strong she is. With the multiple instances of Snake and the Boss going at it with CQC, she owned him. It  was already hard enough to imagine someone more legendary than Solid Snake, but when I find out there is someone that even out classes Big Boss, the power really sinks in. 

### The Ending

When Snake went for the salute and a tear fell down his only working eye, that got to me. In my opinion, one of the greatest endings in any video game I have played thus far. 

## What's Next

Continue working. Code on a website I am working on currently. Improve my coding skills. As for my free time I have a gaming order I plan to follow. I have been chipping away at this back log for a while but this is how the list goes in order:

1. Metal Gear Solid 4: Sons of the Patriots
2. Resident Evil 2 (Remake)
3. Resident Evil 4 (Original)
4. Resident Evil 4 (Remake)
5. Bloodborne

Debating to put a pause on the MGS series and try the Resident Evil games but we will see. Also hopefully I can get to Bloodborne by October, it would be the perfect month to play it. 

That is my mini update and reviews on random things, thanks.
