## What I've Learned
I recently just finished learning the basics of C++ and it gave me a good foundation to go up from there. I learned how use, create and modify variables in different ways, strings and arrays, different expressions, statements and operators, program flow, functions and lastly pointers and references. 

## The Process
When it came down to how I was going through each section, it was pretty straight forward. Each section would start on a new document on my document network that I created (the application I used can be found [here](https://github.com/josedrios/silver-minded)), and I would take notes on the section, highlighting important pieces of information, elaborating more on things that confused me and including examples to show how the information at hand really works. I did this for all 8 lessons in 'Part 1: The Basics'.

### My Obstacle
The main issue I ran into was my obsession with writing every single detail down. In general my note taking is doing exactly what I want it to: write down the concepts in my own words so that I can come back to my notes whenever I need to and clear the confusion but the issue lies on the worry that I am leaving out the world's most important information whenever I don't write something down. For this next section, 'Part II: Fundamentals of Object-Oriented C++ Programming', I plan to cool it with the obsessive note taking and write down the crucial, core concepts of the information at hand. The left out information should be something that can be easily implied by the notes I have already taken. 

As for finding time to study, I delegate a couple hours a day to do so while still being able to work and go out with people I love.

### What I Liked

What I really enjoyed about the material is the way the author composed the textbook. It starts off with a general description of the topic, then we go into why and how the topic should be used, as well as pairing it with examples. Then the examples are followed by an in-depth analysis of what went on in the example. This process is done for every point made for that lesson and then a summary of what was written wraps everything up. The book was created to give the reader a very smooth and easy to follow along experience.

## What's to Come
More C++. I plan to continue learning but in a more 'full throttle' approach. Now with my awareness of my obsession for writing every single detail into my notes I plan to fix this for the coming section. The next section is about the fundamentals of Object-Oriented C++ programming and I am super excited. I plan to polish my OOP with a stronger foundation. Now let me be, let me become OP in OOP.
