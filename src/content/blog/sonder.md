## Where I Am At

*NOTE: LET ME PREFACE THIS BY SAYING I DID NOT REVISE THIS BLOG SO IF I MISSPELT ANYTHING OR SOME STUFF DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, I AM SORRY, I WAS VERY TIRED WRITING THIS*

As of late, I've been building on my current project, whether thats coding or wire framing or just straight up pondering. I have also been doom scrolling on anything that allows it. I don't even have social media but if a platform has a scrolling mechanism, I am dangerously hooked. I have been more tamed about it but, actually its been more tamed than it ever has been, but I want to minimize it even more.

So I am building and destroying right now. Or in other words I am trying to build while being destroyed. Whether that act of destroying is from within or not, it needs to be eliminated. What I am trying to say is that I want to create cool shiznit but the doom scrolling and distractions just occupy my time more than it should. On second thought I don't think this doom scrolling thing is tamed. Even on youtube on my computer I am looking for a video. Once I find one I look for another. And another. And you can guess the rest of the cycle. Not having social media is not the solution. The solution is gaining the strength needed to say 'no' to the doom scrolling gods and then turning your back on them and creating some dope shiznit. If there were doom scroll gods I honestly think the Zuck would be one of them. Probably the TikTok ceo, I have never heard of them but I assume they would be one. I don't know why but I want to throw in Bill Gates in there, just because I hate how bloated the Windows OS is. Completely irrelevant but it just makes sense to me. I don't care if you don't see the vision. To help you paint the picture I image these 'doomscroll gods' like the God Hand (from Berserk). Just a devious council. 

That was a sober, 12:02AM sleepy, mind racing faster than my fastest typing speed thought right there. I'm not going back or editing any of the structure of these sentences either. I'm letting my thoughts barf all over this document.

But back to what I was saying. Actually I never mentioned it. Let me start over. I'm currently working on my current project. Recently, I got my neovim config in order for the most part, probably will tweak stuff later but I am VERY content with where I am at with that, just need to understand lua better. Doom scrolling on platforms like pinterest and youtube has gotten me annoyed, I need to start saying no to my doom scrolling, stimming pleasures and I need to start going ham on creating. 

Literally anything. Creating literally ANYTHING. Just create. 

I have been having that mentally surrounding doom scrolling for quite a while, I want to say a couple months. From now on I will lessen the doom scroll and create more.

## Create What?
Good question. I want to put a pause on the current project I have been working on for months and start working on a 'small', very cool idea I thought of today to make a cool website and very small community. The idea of this website is to write a very stupid, weird, intriguing question once a day to a website and people can comment their takes. Thats it. Super simple. Maybe once a week. Maybe once a week gives people time to digest material and all that. 

So the gist is to create a website that publicizes a new question every week, that really makes the audience ponder and the audience can comment their take on the question. 

THATS IT. Simple, straight to the point. Thats it. Now I can build on it by adding their previous responses to their account page and people can view other peoples accounts. But for right now, that is the whole premise.

Question. People Answer. People read other people's answers if they want (I sure will if anybody ever finds the website). REPEAT

As for the UI I am very excited. I want to create a very simple, neat, organized UI. The design system for it will be really easy to utilize to considering how small this website is going to be. That is going to be fun.

I will like to keep this platform ONLY on the web. Make the web cool again. People need to start surfing the web more.

## Reasons:
- I have always made projects, and some do see the finish line but some don't because I think too big and don't execute the rest. This will let me see the a project all the way through, even to deployment. This will also give me a good breather from my current project. I also just remembers the blog I made about my C++ study. I did study A LOT but I put a pin in it for my current project LOL. Now I am putting a pin in my current project for this new project. You see what I mean. This is the final pin. I think. Hopefully. 
- I want to go full throttle on something. Yea I could go full throttle on my current project but this project is different. It's more linear some what. I know what I want and it is a rather 'simple' goal. Its not like going from point A to B but it is some what in the realm of that. My forearms hurt from typing. Hit a nasty arm day today. I want to work on this every day and know what I am doing because I have a plan and hopefully that will allow me to work back to back to back on this and be obsessed with it.
- I want to create a community, a cool one, this one in particular hopefully will wake those corners in your brain that have not had sunshine in a while and expose it to the rest of the community (I was going to say world here but like come on be real). I will genuinely feel more accomplished if I created a nice community rather than creating the perfect website.
- I noticed each and every one of these reasons starts with 'I'. I kind of sound selfish but to be fair this is a blog about my thoughts. I don't think I can be blamed for that.

Thats it. I am really tired. So tired I am not going to revise it because its already late and I work in the morning. Maybe I will read this later, see how stupid some of the things I was trying to say was and come back and revise it. We will see. I will find the strength to create and keep creating.
