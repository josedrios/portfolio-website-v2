### I Took a Slight Break from C++ Learning

This is probably my fourth blog, I'm starting to realize that sometimes keeping things short is just better. I want these blogs to reflect that when needed. For about a week or two I took a slight break from learning and practicing coding, kind of. I wanted to take a break from learning concepts that are in the same 'space' and detoured a little to game development. 

Tweaked around with Godot and Unity and discovered how cool these tools are. I was specifically really into making isometric games. It was fun. I know I said I took a rest from my learning journey just to learn something else but it was a nice change in pace that was needed. I wanted a small break from the learning routine I typically had. Now I am back and super excited to dive right into C++ material again.

### I Watched Fantastic 4

It was fantastic. Enter Miles Teller. Not going to say much here because of spoilers (given the 0.0001% chance that someone is even reading this), but my favorite part was when Silver Surfer first appeared and shifted the entire tone of the movie. She was my favorite character in this movie. 

After the movie I spent like an hour and a half talking to my cousing Carlos about random games and comics and all that jazz. The biggest take away was to read the comic 'Parabole'. I don't know if thats the name of the comic but thats the best way I can reference that comic or that comic arc. It's about Silver Surfer and when I asked him what's one word to describe this piece of art, he said "existential" (I'm not going to check if I spelt that word right, just know I gave it my best shot). That's all I needed to know. As a man who is in a point in his life where I have no idea what to do and who I want to become exactly, I naturally became curious of this comic. I'm very excited to read this. 

So right now I am very excited to learn C++ and to read a comic with Silver Surfer. Goodnight(11:28PM).
