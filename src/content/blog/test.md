## I Chose Blogging Over Doom Scrolling

I used to use social media a lot, too much actually. The typical doom scroll line up: Instagram, Snapchat, Tiktok, Youtube Shorts. I would wake up, doom scroll, after eating breakfast and showering, doom scroll, I'm assuming you can predict the pattern for the rest of my day. 

I decided to change my ways and fully commit to an environment where scrolling on my phone is significantly reduced. I removed Instagram, Snapchat and Tiktok from my phone. I stuck with Youtube (I feel like every man needs Youtube when eating) and not too long ago I started using Pinterest (For UI inspiration). That's its. 

### My Online Presence

These two apps alone served me right for a good period of time until I realized that all I am doing is consuming and not giving at all. I want to be able to put something out there and have the possibility of other people finding my creations. I felt like I was the sick kid stuck inside watching all the other kids play outside (maybe the analogy is a little extreme considering I can just post on Snapchat or Instagram but it will do). The best I found to get out and play was by adding a blog section to my website. This is my social media. It's perfect. 

The demographic of people who will find this is probably people who know me if they make the effort to find this page and people randomly wandering on the interwebs. To me, knowing that my entire following on social media is people I know, I feel like there is some sort of pressure on there to post. Here on the other hand, the only people that will see this are the ones who made the effort to find the post.

I want to release my thoughts and ideas to the world and the best way I can do that is through this blog page. 

## What Will I Post?

I am most excited about writing and talking about the most random, useless things and leaving it here. 

### List of Potential Options
- books I've read
- video games I've beat
- hobbies I dabble in
- things I'm learning
- biographies of cool people
- random thoughts and ideas

There are many things I find myself thinking about for hours and this page seems like just the place to put those thoughts and ideas.

## Inspiration

I was inspired to write my own blog after visiting the blog of [Gary Robinson](https://garyrobinson.net/) (alongside with the natural urge to create). This dude is very interesting. Robinson is a developer who has blogs pertaining to various concepts and ideas and I thought it would be cool if I did the same. 

## Limitations

When it comes to what can possibly hold me back from utilizing my blog posts to their fullest potential I could not really think of anything grand. Anxiety wouldn't hold me back because there is not a large audience (if one at all) to worry about. Accessibility is not an issue considering I just have to write an .md file and push it to my github repository (CI/CD). 

The only issue is the 0.00001 kb of storage cloud platforms provide to developers to deploy websites. To be fair they need their profit margins but dude the storage they give you is so low. I am using Vercel, which is provides a very seamless and easy to deploy my website but the thing is I dont know how fast I'm going to use up all my storage. Also retrieving the data for this website has a limitation as well. I would probably use that all up on my own by refreshing my own website 1,000 times over again reading my own blogs. We'll see how it goes though.

## I'm Officially a Blogger

Now I wait. I wait for the 10x ego boost and 100x increase in brain power abilities one naturally gets when becoming a blogger. In all seriousness I look forward to writing here. Hopefully this website stays within its bounds on the Vercel cloud or else I am going to have to pay around $20 a month to keep a website that only I read. 

Thank you for reading, until next time.

PS: This is my first blog so ignore any typos if there are any. Thanks.
